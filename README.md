# BaBarDataPreparation

Big data "pipeline" developed during my Ph.D. to process low-level data from the BaBar detector (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) and output a reduced physics dataset. This was notably used for "Measurement of the B0->pilnu form-factor shape and branching fraction, and determination of |Vub| with a loose neutrino reconstruction technique", BaBar Collaboration, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 (2007).

The final analysis step is done with siebling package `HistoMaker`.
