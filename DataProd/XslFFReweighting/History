Tag V00-03-00
=============
11-27-04 D. Cote
        Implemented the B->D*lnu form factor reweighting functionalities in 
        in XSL classes inheriting from the XSLEvtFFWeight interface.
        Simplified the XSLKin code to now fit on single (and still simple)
        concrete class. Removed all the non-XSL code, which is now useles 
        and/or is a duplication of code in the DStarLNuFFAnal package. 
        Following these actions, the package is now free of dependencies to:
        override LINK_PDT                  += XslFFReweighting
        override LINK_ROOT                 += XslFFReweighting
        override LINK_difAlgebra           += XslFFReweighting
	which will help for its design goal to be usable outside the BaBar
        Framework.

Tag V00-02-00
=============
10-08-04 M. Kelsey
	Restored CLtoRoot.hh and EcsKinVars to break unnecessary dependence
	upon EcsAnalysis code, and to support use of package by Jim Libby
	and others.

Numerous files updated, removed, and renamed by David Cote-Ahern.

Tag V00-01-00
=============
10-4-04 M. Kelsey
	Migrate to Release 15.7.1.  Code should be merged with David
	Cote-Ahern's updates, which he is pulling out of ISLUser.  Moved
	EcsKinVars out to EcsAnalysis.

	Committed first complete, compiling, functioning version
	of this package.  Contains classes DStarLNuPDF and DStarLNuMoments,
	which are adapted and improved versions of Art Snyders
	implementation from DStarLNuFFAnal, along with versions of
	the needed supporting classes.  Was done to eliminate dependence
	on DStarLNuFFAnal, which has spiderwebbed dependencies on
	a number of other packages.  The only other package that 
	this package requires is the latest tag of difAlgebra.

5-10-04 A. Weinstein
	Moved EcsKinVars into this package.  Induces slight dependence
        on EcsUser, but makes available to other users.
